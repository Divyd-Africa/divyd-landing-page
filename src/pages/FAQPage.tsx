            answer: "Divyd is a social-first finance app that simplifies how friends and small groups manage shared expenses. Whether it's splitting bills, tracking who owes what, or repaying each other, Divyd makes the process seamless and stress-free.",

            id: 2,
            question: "Do I need to link my bank account?",
            answer: "No, not at all. To make transfers, all you need to do is fund your Divyd Wallet. Once set up, you can easily receive, or transfer money securely and in real-time, with no complex steps or external apps required.",

            id: 3,
            question: "Is Divyd safe to use?",

            id: 4,
            question: "How is this different from just sending money with my bank app?",
            answer: "DIVYD helps track, remind, and repay shared expenses automatically,no awkward texts or forgotten transfers rather then the traditional bank apps.",

        {
            id: 5,
            question: "What is Pre-approved transfers and how does it work?",
            answer:
                "Pre-Approved Transfers allow you to authorize automatic deductions for shared expenses up to a set limit. Once a transaction is logged by the person who paid, Divyd immediately debits your approved amount from your linked card or Divyd Wallet â€” no manual confirmation needed. This makes repayments faster, smoother, and more reliable among trusted connections.",
